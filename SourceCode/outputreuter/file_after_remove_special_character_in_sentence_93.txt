curbs tradeLucia Mutikani5 Min ReadWASHINGTON Reuters The US current account deficit dipped to a near twoyear low in the first quarter as the COVID19 pandemic restricted the flow of goods and services while companies continued to repatriate profits back homeFILE PHOTO A worker unloads a delivery from Indonesia at CNC Cabinetry in South Plainfield New Jersey US June 16 2020REUTERSAndrew KellyFile PhotoThe Commerce Department said on Friday the current account deficit which measures the flow of goods services and investments into and out of the country slipped 01 to 1042 billion the smallest since the second quarter of 2018A drop in imports and income payments narrowly outpaced a decline in exports and income receiptsData for the fourth quarter was revised to show the gap narrowing to 1043 billion instead of 1098 billion as previously reportedEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast the current account gap shrinking to 103 billion in the JanuaryMarch quarterThe current account gap represented 19 of gross domestic product in the first quarter the smallest share since the third quarter of 2017The figures reinforce a dire outlook for trade and we expect import and export volumes to drop at record rates this year said James Watson a senior US economist at Oxford Economics in New YorkWith global demand falling further than domestic demand we expect the current account to widen sharply in the second quarter The Commerce Departments Bureau of Economic Analysis which compiles the data attributed the drop in part due to the impact of COVID19 as many businesses were operating at limited capacity or ceased operations completely and the movement of travelers across borders was restricted Exports plunged to a 10year low in April which economists said set up the current account deficit to widen to as much as 120 billion in the second quarterIn the first quarter exports of goods and services and income received from foreign residents fell 475 billion the biggest drop in 11 years to 9022 billionThat was the lowest level since the third quarter of 2017Imports of goods and services and income payments to foreign residents declined 477 billion to 101 trillion also the lowest level since the third quarter of 2017That drop was also the biggest since the first quarter of 2009PROFITS REPATRIATED Despite the disruptions caused by the pandemic American companies repatriated 1242 billion in profits in the first quarter the most in over a year up from 836 billion in the prior periodA surge in repatriations in 2018 was fueled by a Republican tax overhaul which reduced much of the tax liability for bringing back earnings from foreign subsidiaries although the flows subsided substantially in 2019A large portion of the repatriated money funded stock buybacks and dividendsIt was not immediately clear whether the surge in the first quarter was directly a result of US companies need to shore up their domestic balance sheetsIn the early stages of the coronavirus crisis however activity in corporate funding markets all but dried up and companies broadly tapped into whatever sources of liquidity were availableGRAPHIC US companies repatriated foreign earnings here Even before the COVID19 pandemic the import bill had been shrinking because of the Trump administrations trade war with ChinaThe United States has also become a net exporter of crude and fuel the result of a production surge that has dramatically reduced the nations dependence on foreign oilGoods trade with China collapsed in the first quarterInvestment income also took a hit last

quarterThere was a record drop in foreign direct investmentPrimary income receipts fell 278 billion to 2551 billionThe deficit on secondary income which includes US government grants pensions fines and penalties and worker remittances increased 11 billion to a record 376 billionThe Federal Reserves expansion of currency swap lines with more than a dozen foreign central banks to ease a global
