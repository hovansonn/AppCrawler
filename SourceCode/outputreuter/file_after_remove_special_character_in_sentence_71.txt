allpetrol or diesel counterparts under new clean car rules making it easier for automakers to meet environment quotas and offer more choiceFILE PHOTO A Toyota Levin plugin hybrid vehicle is displayed

as it battles unhealthy levels of air pollution in its crowded citiesThose rules have pushed both domestic and international automakers including Tesla Inc TSLAO and Volkswagen AG VOWG_pDE to spend billions of dollars on the development and production of new energy vehicles NEVs such as allelectric plugin hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell vehiclesPlugin hybrid technology differs from that of petrolelectric hybrid vehiclesAutomakers in China are obliged to manufacture NEVs to win points to make up for a portion of the negative points they incur when they produce internal combustion engine vehiclesHowever the system has been criticised for offering few incentives for automakers to improve petrol cars efficiencyThe policy published on Monday by Chinas Ministry of Industry and Information Technology allows automakers to gradually make more petrolelectric hybrids and less of the more costly allelectric vehicles from 2021 through 2023Such hybrids would still be considered fossilfuelled but reclassified as low fuel consumption passenger vehiclesSignificantly the number of negative points incurred for making petrolelectric hybrids will be less than for petrolonly vehiclesThat could see more of those traditionally powered vehicles replaced with petrolelectric hybrids experts and industry officials said because when automakers produce those hybrids they would not have as many negative points to make up forExperts have said the beneficiaries of such change would include global petrolelectric hybrid leaders Toyota Motor Corp 7203T and Honda Motor Co Ltd 7267T as well as Chinese makers Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd 0175HK Guangzhou Automobile Group Co Ltd 601238SS and supplier Hunan Corun New Energy Co Ltd 600478SSChina hopes NEVs will account for around a quarter of
