oldschool bond traders towards an electronic futureDhara Ranasinghe Saikat Chatterjee8 Min ReadLONDON Reuters The mammoth bond market has long been the oldschool bastion of the financial world but the COVID19 pandemic has cast a light on its future and it looks electronicWell mainlyFILE PHOTO People walk through the Canary Wharf financial district of London Britain December 7 2018REUTERSSimon Dawson At the height of the market panic in March Seattlebased Brandon Rasmussen a senior fixedincome trader at 300 billion asset manager Russell Investments had a client order to sell 25 billion worth of US TreasuriesHe found though that such a transaction was nearimpossible in a highly volatile market that made no exceptions for even one of the worlds most soughtafter assetsDealers refused to quote prices by phone adding to the stress of executing a large order without distorting the marketThe solution Rasmussen eventually settled on was to break the order up into smaller chunks and process them electronically something he may not have considered a few weeks earlierThe feedback that we got from dealers was that they were not quoting on the phoneThey couldnt do that they couldnt keep up with that he saidI think what this crisis has shown is that really if you werent trading electronically you should be trading electronically His experience illustrates how the volatility caused by the crisis along with a new remote mindset of working from home has pushed more traders to go digital in a market that has historically lagged stocks and forex in electronificationThat trend is reflected in the business on electronic bondtrading platformsFor example MarketAxess one of the biggest players enjoyed record trading volumes in MarchAt rival Tradeweb average daily turnover hit a record aggregate 1 trillion in that month a more than 41 yearonyear increaseMeanwhile MTS part of the London Stock Exchange Group said it won several large asset managers in Europe as clients during the crisisYet traders stress that dealers and clients speaking to one another will long remain a key component of the industry especially at times of heightened volatilityEven as Rasmussen went electronic to push through his trade for example he was also talking to buyers to agree switches swapping one type of US bond for another to share riskThe jump in electronic trading activity coincided with both a rush into government bonds as the coronavirus sparked demand for safehaven assets and then a sharp selloff as investors sold their most liquid assets to make up for losses elsewhereGraphic Electronic bond trading activity surges in March here LIQUIDITY TRANSPARENCY Electronic trading where transactions are carried out using software on online platforms rather than via dealerclient voice trades can carry major benefits for the 100 trillionplus world of government and corporate debtRegulations such as MiFID II in Europe to improve transparency have also boosted electronic tradingFor one traders executing deals can quickly gauge market depth on their screens freeing time for more complex tradesFor another it offers lower costs for investors two dealers estimated it to be 1030 cheaper than traditional voice tradesNonetheless while most bond industry players acknowledge that much of the future is digital many have been reluctant to go fully electronicAround 45 of the European fixedincome market is electronically traded versus 38 a year ago consultancy Greenwich Associates estimatesIn the 66 trillionaday currency market 90 of spot trading is conducted digitallyHowever the COVID19 crisis is accelerating the electronification of the bond market according to industry playersMany such as Tony Rodriguez USbased head of fixed income strategy at Nuveen Asset Management said a need for greater liquidity had boosted electronic trading activityA lot of trades were pushed electronically because of greater liquidity and transparency so the crisis pushed what was already in place he saidAndrew Falco global head of FX and fixed income trading at Fidelity International in London credits electronic trading with allowing connectivity in a market suddenly dispersed by remote workingThis kind of technology enabled the transition from working in an office to working from kitchen tables he told ReutersHe said some lessons had been learned about this last year when Fidelitys Hong Kong team struggled to work in the office because of the unrest roiling the citySo for us in 2020 we finessed the etrading home setup and ensured it worked well whether it was in HK Shanghai Dublin or the UK he addedGraphic etrading impact on bond market liquidity Greenwich here IMAGINE THIS 25 YEARS AGO For the banks who provide dealer and execution services though the electronic shift may be eating into fixedincome revenues during the March quarter earnings from bond trading at the worlds biggest 12 banks remained below levels seen in 2014 research firm Coalition calculatesSlideshow 3 ImagesBut they too are accelerating the push to digital services particularly for the automation that helps them when volatility spikesJP Morgan for instance uses an algorithm to help generate price quotes on its forward FX platform which includes bonds fielding hundreds of thousands of enquiries and transacting thousands of trades a day during the crisis said Tom Prickett cohead of EMEA rates at the bankAnother big player Goldman Sachs said clients ramped up calls for the electronification and automation of companies bond sales until now a slow process conducted manuallyThe crisis revealed some of those shortcomings in bright lights said David Wilkins Goldmans head of FICC execution services in EMEAInvestors and traders acknowledged that digital technology had been a saviour during the pandemic a view expressed across a host of industriesImagine something like this happening 25 years ago when emails didnt exist electronic communication was not really there said Zoeb Sachee head of euro linear rates trading at Citibank who oversees government bond trading in European marketsTHE OLD AND THE NEW But for the foreseeable future at least the bond market is likely to encompass the old and the new technology as well as traditional trading models based on dealerclient relationshipsTraders of European investmentgrade corporate bonds during the crisis often negotiated deals by phone before using a platform to settle according to an International Capital Market Association ICMA reportBond markets are very much relationshipdriven and I dont see how that goes away said report author Andy HillThis was echoed by Falco at FidelityThe view that we felt as a team was that we would use technology where we had confidence in the price that we could see on the screen and when we didnt have the confidence in the price we would execute manually Graphic Change in use of etrading protocols during the crisis ICMA here Reporting by Dhara Ranasinghe and
