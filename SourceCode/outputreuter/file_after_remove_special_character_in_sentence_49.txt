spying on users of Googles Chrome shows new security weaknessJoseph Menn5 Min ReadSAN FRANCISCO Reuters A newly discovered spyware effort attacked users through 32 million downloads of extensions to Googles marketleading Chrome web browser researchers at Awake Security told Reuters highlighting the tech industrys failure to protect browsers as they are used more for email payroll and other sensitive functionsAlphabet Incs GOOGLO Google said it removed more than 70 of the malicious addons from its official Chrome Web Store after being alerted by the researchers last monthWhen we are alerted of extensions in the Web Store that violate our policies we take action and use those incidents as training material to improve our automated and manual analyses Google spokesman Scott Westover told ReutersMost of the free extensions purported to warn users about questionable websites or convert files from one format to anotherInstead they siphoned off browsing history and data that provided credentials for access to internal business toolsBased on the number of downloads it was the most farreaching malicious Chrome store campaign to date according to Awake cofounder and chief scientist Gary GolombGoogle declined to discuss how the latest spyware compared with prior campaigns the breadth of the damage or why it did not detect and remove the bad extensions on its own despite past promises to supervise offerings more closelyIt is unclear who was behind the effort to distribute the malwareAwake said the developers supplied fake contact information when they submitted the extensions to GoogleAnything that gets you into somebodys browser or email or other sensitive areas would be a target for national espionage as well as organized crime said former National Security Agency engineer Ben Johnson who founded security companies Carbon Black and Obsidian SecurityThe extensions were designed to avoid detection by antivirus companies or security software that evaluates the reputations of web domains Golomb saidIf someone used the browser to surf the web on a home computer it would connect to a series of websites and transmit information the researchers foundAnyone using a corporate network which would include security services would not transmit the sensitive information or even reach the malicious versions of the websitesThis shows how attackers can use extremely simple methods to hide in this case thousands of malicious domains Golomb saidAfter this storys publication Awake released its research including the list of domains and extensionshere All of the domains in question more than 15000 linked to each other in total were purchased from a small registrar in Israel Galcomm known formally as CommuniGal Communication LtdAwake said Galcomm should have known what was happeningIn an email exchange Galcomm owner Moshe Fogel told Reuters that his company had done nothing wrongGalcomm is not involved and not in complicity with any malicious activity whatsoever Fogel wroteYou can say exactly the opposite we cooperate with law enforcement and security bodies to prevent as much as we can Fogel said there was no record of the inquiries Golomb said he made in April and again in May to the companys email address for reporting abusive behavior and he asked for a list of suspect domainsAfter publication Fogel said the majority of those domain names were inactive and that he would continue to investigate the othersThe Internet Corp for Assigned Names and Numbers which oversees registrars said it had received few complaints about Galcomm over the years and none about malwareWhile deceptive extensions have been a problem for years they are getting worseThey initially spewed unwanted advertisements and now are more likely to install additional malicious programs or track where users are and what they are doing for government or commercial spiesFILE PHOTO The logo of Google is seen in Davos Switzerland Januar 20

in 2018 here it would improve security in part by increasing human reviewBut in February independent researcher Jamila Kaya and Cisco Systems Duo Security uncovered here a similar Chrome campaign that stole data from about 17 million usersGoogle joined the investigation and found 500 fraudulent extensionsWe do regular sweeps to find extensions using similar techniques code and behaviors Googles
