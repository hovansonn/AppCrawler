to cut ties with Beijing a day after highlevel USChina talksAndrea Shalal David Brunnstrom5 Min ReadWASHINGTON Reuters President Donald Trump on Thursday renewed his threat to cut ties with China a day after his top diplomats held talks with Beijing and his trade representative said he did not consider decoupling the US and Chinese economies a viable optionThe top US diplomat for East Asia described USChina relations as tense after their first highlevel facetoface diplomatic talks in months although he said Beijing did recommit to the first part of a trade deal reached this year and that coming weeks would show if there had been progressTrump has made rebalancing the massive US trade deficit with China a top priority but relations have worsened steadily as his campaign for reelection in November heats upIt was not Ambassador Lighthizers fault yesterday in Committee in that perhaps I didnt make myself clear Trump said in a tweet referring to his trade representative Robert LighthizerBut the US certainly does maintain a policy option under various conditions of a complete decoupling from China Lighthizer told a House of Representatives committee on Wednesday he did not see that as viableDo I think that you can sit down and decouple the United States economy from the Chinese economy he saidNo I think that was a policy option years agoI dont think its a reasonable policy option at this point His office had no immediate comment on Trumps tweetUSChina relations have reached their lowest point in years since the coronavirus pandemic that began in China hit the United States hard and Trump and his administration have repeatedly accused Beijing of not being transparent about the outbreakMULTIPLE POINTS OF FRICTION Among multiple points of friction the countries are also at odds over Chinas moves to impose new security legislation on Hong Kong which have prompted Trump to initiate a process to eliminate special US treatment for the territoryTrump made clear the deterioration in the relationship last month when he said he had no interest in speaking right now to President Xi Jinping whom he has hailed as a friend and suggesting he could even cut ties with ChinaLighthizer said he expected to see more supply chains moving to the United States because of tax and regulatory changes but also noted that the USChina trade deal would result in significant positive changes and increased Chinese purchases of US goods and servicesThe Phase 1 USChina trade deal calls for China to buy 200 billion in additional US goods and services over two years but skeptics say the pandemic and resulting economic slowdowns will make it difficult for Beijing to reach its targets for this yearUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met Chinas top diplomat Yang Jiechi for a day of talks in Hawaii on Wednesday but those appear to have done little to improve the moodAs the Hawaii meeting began Trump signed legislation calling for sanctions against those responsible for repression of Uighur Muslims in Chinas Xinjiang region prompting Beijing to threaten retaliationDavid Stilwell the assistant secretary for East Asia told reporters that Chinas attitude in the talks could not be described as forthcoming and described relations as tense He said recent Chinese actions over India in the South China Sea and over Hong Kong had not been constructive and that Washington looked forward to seeing China reconsider its plans for security legislation for Hong KongAt the same time Stilwell said China did recommit to following through on the trade agreement and added that efforts to persuade North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons were another area of potential cooperationThe trade deal the Chinese have recommitted to that numerous times and they insist that they will follow through Stilwell saidThis is a good acid test to see if they will be cooperative partners Well see in the next week or two or however long it takes if they begin to live up to their commitments he saidChina described the Hawaii talks as constructive but its Foreign Ministry said Yang told Pompeo that Washington needed to respect Beijings positions on key issues and halt its interference in matters such as Hong Kong Taiwan and Xinjiang while working to repair relationsFILE PHOTO Chinese and US flags flutter near The Bund before US trade delegation meet their
