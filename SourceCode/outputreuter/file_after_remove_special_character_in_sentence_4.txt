HermanSome intensive care specialists are trying to hire more permanent staffOthers want to create a reservist army of medical professionals ready to be deployed wherever needed to work in wards with seriously ill patientsEuropean countries have been giving medics crash courses in how to deal with COVID19 patients and are now looking at ways to retrain staff to avoid shortages of key workers if there is a second wave of the novel coronavirusWe need a healthcare army said Maurizio Cecconi presidentelect of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine ESICM which brings together medics from around the world who work in wards with extremely ill patientsCecconi who heads the intensive care department at the Humanitas hospital in Milan says medical staff need to be more flexible in the work they do and more mobileIf there is another big wave we should be prepared to deploy doctors and nurses from nearby regions within ItalyThis did not happen a lot in the first wave he told ReutersMany countries were caught unprepared by the COVID19 pandemic in March and April and hastily retrained medics to work with patients with severe cases of the disease to ramp up numbers and replace those who fell sickSome sent medical students and retired doctors to help out in intensive care wards as hospital staff were overwhelmedThose worsthit by the pandemic had to provide more beds and essential equipment for acute care units and some built new hospitalsBut problems and shortages persistItaly for example may need to boost by 50 the number of anaesthetists resuscitation experts and other medics it has working in intensive care according to the Italian society of intensive care SIAARTICRASH COURSES Across Europe hospitals have been retraining surgeons cardiologists internal medicine physicians and nurses from other departments and have moved them to intensive care units when neededMany have attended crash courses on how to handle COVID19 patients said Jozef Kesecioglu president of ESICM and head of intensive care at the University Medical Center of Utrecht in the NetherlandsWe gave them jobs with less responsibility such as washing patients turning patients around checking the lungs or looking at scans he told ReutersIntensive care specialists had continued to do the most delicate work such as handling tubes in patients throats or adjusting mechanical ventilation Kesecioglu saidHe plans to call back the same people to offer them more trainingUnder normal circumstances intensive care workers undergo years of training but he said We should not wait until the new wave comes we should give them regular training The Netherlands is trying to recruit more skilled workers and hopes to narrow structural gaps in the intensive care workforce said Rotterdams Erasmus Medical Centre one of the largest university hospitals in EuropeSIAARTI says medical students who specialise in intensive care medicine should be fully integrated into wards for the last two years of their fiveyear training and has recommended financial incentives be offered to attract more studentsThe European Commission the European Unions executive funded crossborder transfers of medical staff to the most affected countries at the height of the coronavirus crisisIn April teams of flying doctors were sent from Norway and Romania to ItalySlideshow 3 ImagesBut the experiment has failed to gather much support and Cecconi said moving doctors from one country to another should be an option but not the first option as language barriers may make them less effectiveSome patients were also moved around to receive treatmentFrance transferred some to lessaffected regions of the country and sent others to Germany which also took in COVID19 patients from ItalyBut Cecconi warned of transportation risks and logistical complicationsOften our patients are very sick he saidId rather have skilled people who know how to work in my environment Reporting by Francesco Guarascio in
