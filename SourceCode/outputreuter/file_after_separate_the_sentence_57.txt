And, as you can see, we are here at the very start of our development,” he said.If the estimates are right, the online trade of consumer goods in Russia could reach 500 billion roubles annually, compared with the 60-billion-rouble estimates by analysts before the pandemic.Across the globe, the outbreak has accelerated change.For Sbermarket, where the shift to online shopping was already underway, the leap in orders after Russia introduced quarantine measures in March meant it took only 71 days to reach 2 million orders after it had taken almost seven years to achieve 1 million.Reporting by Olga Popova; Writing by Alexander Marrow; editing by Barbara LewisOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.More From ReutersAdvertisementTrendingChina likely lost at least 40 soldiers in border clash: Indian ministerTikTok users, K-pop fans say they helped sabotage Trump rally with false registrationsSouth Korea says Bolton's memoir on Trump-Kim summit is distortedInflation dog may finally bark, investors betTrump says he will announce visa restrictions Sunday or Monday: Fox News interviewReuters News NowSubscribe to our daily curated newsletter to receive the latest exclusive Reuters coverage delivered to your inbox.Submit1366 : 576narrow-browser-and-phonemedium-browser-and-portrait-tabletlandscape-tabletmedium-wide-browserwide-browser-and-largermedium-browser-and-landscape-tabletmedium-wide-browser-and-largerabove-phoneportrait-tablet-and-aboveabove-portrait-tabletlandscape-tablet-and-abovelandscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browserportrait-tablet-and-belowlandscape-tablet-and-belowAppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.See here for a complete list of exchanges and delays.© 2020 Reuters.All Rights Reserved.X
