He was responding to the decision by the United States to pull out of negotiations on a global solution to taxing digital services on Wednesday. “I very much regret the U.S.’ move to put the brakes on international talks on taxation of the digital economy. I hope that this will be a temporary setback rather than a definitive stop,” Gentiloni said. “The European Commission wants a global solution to bring corporate taxation into the 21st century – and we believe the OECD’s two-pillar approach is the right one,” he said. “But if that proves impossible this year, we have been clear that we will come forward with a new proposal at EU level<’ he said.
