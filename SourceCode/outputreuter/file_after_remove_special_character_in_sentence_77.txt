speech that the Fed is testing banks against three possible economic trajectories of varying severity to see how they perform citing unprecedented uncertainty about the pandemics longterm economic impactThose results will help the Fed decide whether banks can pay out extra funds to investors via dividends or share repurchasesQuarless remarks Friday mark the first details the Fed has provided on its rampedup stress tests which the central bank said it was augmenting in April with pandemicrelated sensitivity analyses The extra portions of the test will see how banks perform against three plausible economic outcomes a rapid Vshaped recovery a slower Ushaped recovery and a tumultuous Wshaped recoveryThe latter two are expected to be more severe than the original Fed stress test according to QuarlesHowever the Fed is not going to use those results to dictate how much banks must hold as a capital cushionRather Quarles said the original test scenario will continue to provide the basis for each banks capital levelsInstead the Fed will consider the extra analysis in evaluating bank plans to distribute excess capital including through dividends and share repurchasesThe sensitivity analysis will help the Fed Board assess whether additional measures are advisable for certain banks or certain future developments said Quarles according to prepared remarksQuarles said banks will be able to draw up capital plans after receiving their test results and the Fed will announce each firms final capital requirements later this year before they take effect in the fourth quarterWhile banks grumbled about the late change to this years test Quarles acknowledged that the Feds original scenario published in February had been overtaken by the actual economic downturn in several ways forcing adjustmentsWe simply would not have been doing our jobs if we had just run the test using a scenario framed before the economy began to deteriorate in March he said according to prepared remarksThe Fed is due to publish the 2020 test results on June 25Quarles said the Fed will provide firmspecific data on its original test as in prior years but only provide aggregate data on how banks performed in the additional pandemic analysisReporting by Pete Schroeder Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Andrea RicciOur StandardsThe Thomson Reuters Trust PrinciplesSponsored Video by Getting
