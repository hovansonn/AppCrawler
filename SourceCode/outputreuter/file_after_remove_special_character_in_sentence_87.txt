security law4 Min ReadHONG KONG Reuters Following are reactions to the details of draft national security legislation for Hong Kong that were unveiled by Beijing on SaturdayAngeline Chan Solicitor and Progressive Lawyers Group Convenor Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam to cherry pick judges is one of most concerning things for usIts an act to import political elements into the judiciary system which is supposed to be impartialLam should not be entitled to cherry pick judges in the name of protecting national security Moh Siong Sim a currency analyst at the Bank of Singapore We may have to wait to see how the US responds to the latest developments which could matter to marketsIt will be interesting to see how this squares with the latest positive headlines on the Phase One trade deal Song Seng Wun economist at CIMB Private Bank in Singapore Since Hong Kong is an inseparable part of China the new law only matters to those who intend to undermine the rule of law of China Hong KongFor the average person life goes onShould investors look at HK any differentlyAre they at any risksCan they still make money as they used to because of this new lawSince the answer is that they can still make money as they used to in this financial centre then worries about Hong Kong being undermined by this new law are greatly exaggerated Fred Hu chairman of Primavera Capital Group It is reassuring that judges in Hong Kong will hear cases under the national security legislationIt isnt surprising that the National Peoples Congress retains the power to interpret the lawAs long as the NPC refrains from interfering with the Hong Kong court decisions most of the time that is it chooses to intervene rarely in only exceptional cases then the general public and the business community in Hong Kong should be just fine to live with the new national security legislation regimeIt seems the worst fears people have had about the law arent validated at least judging from the laws key features Simon Young a barrister and professor at the University of Hong Kongs law school From these initial details this new law presents unprecedented legal questions that we will have to confront in coming years Giving the citys chief executive the power to allocate judges in national security cases would encroach on something we would say is part of judicial power Ken Cheung chief Asian FX strategist at Mizuho Bank Hong Kong I dont see a lot in this right nowChinas action was within expectationMore important now is the US reactionAt this point I think the impact is neutralThis doesnt change a lot right now Alvin Yeung a prodemocracy lawmaker Most worrying is it lacks details when it comes to specific criminal action and that remains highly vague which is of course extremely worryingMore importantly its almost like Beijings hand is right in the centre of the administrative and judiciary wing of Hong KongThe chief executive will be empowered to pick her own judges to trial cases of national security but what are the details Steven Leung Hong Kongbased sales director UOB Kay Hian Overall I think the financial markets have been expecting an outcome like this so it doesnt come as a huge surpriseWe have been talking about this for some time now and despite the markets in Hong Kong have been quite stableWe havent seen huge capital outflowsHong Kong will remain a global financial centre dont think that will change in the near termIn a way its a good thing that the uncertainty around the law has gone now Reporting by Jessie Pang Sumeet Chatterjee Kane Wu Greg Torode Noah Sin Anshuman Daga Compiled by Anne
