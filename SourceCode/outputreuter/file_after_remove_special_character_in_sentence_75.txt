takes a hit investors widen climate change campaignMatthew Green Simon Jessop6 Min ReadLONDON Reuters Investors managing 18 trillion 22 trillion in assets are widening a campaign pressing oil majors to better reflect climate risks in their accounting and will soon target other businesses with heavy fossil fuel exposure the group said on MondayFILE PHOTO Natasha LandellMills head of stewardship at Sarasin Partners poses for a photograph at their office in London Britain November 28 2019REUTERSPeter Nicholls The investors believe their campaign is working noting the hugely important news of BP BPL joining other oil majors in lowering the value of its assets amid a global transition to cleaner energy said Natasha LandellMills head of stewardship at asset manager Sarasin PartnersThe question all company directors and their shareholders now need urgently answered is Where else might company positions be overstated the group of more than 20 leading funds said in a joint statement seen by ReutersBP declined to comment on the campaignThe investor group cant be certain whether its efforts played into BPs decision to reduce the value of its assets by up to 175 billion announced on June 15But they have already begun lobbying building materials company CRH CRHI and plan to write to AngloAustralian miner Rio Tinto RIOLRIOAX which supplies the steel industryAlong with cement steel is a major source of greenhouse gasesWe will be rolling out similar engagements with other fossil fueldependent companies LandellMills who is coordinating the campaign told Reuters in an interviewThe investors were also planning to include European and US banks financing fossil fuel projects LandellMills addedRio Tinto and CRH declined to commentEarly last year the investors began lobbying the Big Four accounting firms EY Deloitte PwC and KPMG to do more to ensure climaterelated risks are adequately reflected in company financial statements they auditThe campaign is one of a number of efforts by investors to push companies on environmental policies amid concerns many businesses are both contributing to the planets warming while also failing to take full stock of the risks they faceMajor fund managers including BlackRock BLKN have issued increasingly strident public statements about climate change while other investors have threatened to pull money out of Brazil unless Amazon deforestation is curbedThe campaign led by Sarasin Partners emphasizes the legal duty companies have to ensure their financial statements fully reflect how government moves to ratchet up climate action and the falling costs of renewable energy are likely to affect future profitabilityIts a very serious thing from their perspective said LandellMillsThis is a matter of ensuring there is no misrepresentation going on Accounting for potential future losses can weaken a companys balance sheet making it harder to finance new investment in carbonintensive activities such as oil exploration the investors argueThe coalition includes Sarasin Partners MG Investments Jupiter Asset Management NN Investment Partners and pension funds such as the Brunel Pension Partnership and Denmarks PKAPOTENTIALLY OVERSTATING Although it was difficult to independently assess the impact of the campaign LandellMills pointed to a series of moves that align with the investors demands in letters here sent to BP AngloDutch major Shell RDSaL and Frances Total TOTFPA in NovemberIn the letters seen by Reuters the investors questioned whether the companies oil price assumptions which form the bedrock of their accounts were aligned with the 2015 Paris climate accord which implies sharp cuts in fossil fuel useBefore BPs writedown the groups letter to the British oil major said We have concerns that at present BPs accounts may be overlooking material climate considerations and consequently potentially overstating both performance and capital The same language was used with Shell and TotalTotal did not immediately respond to a request for a commentShell said it had comprehensively responded to similar demands by the investor group and included climate risks in its accountsSince that time Shell has also published an ambition to be a net zero energy company by 2050 or sooner Shell said in an email to Reuters on SundayLast week BP cut its benchmark Brent oil price forecasts to an average of 55 a barrel until 2050 from 70 saying it expects a collapse in oil demand during the coronavirus pandemic to accelerate a lowcarbon transitionBP also said it would have to review some plans for early stage oil and gas exploration projectsMeanwhile Shell also lowered its longterm Brent crude expectations to 60 a barrel from the 2018 price of 70 in its 2019 annual report published in MarchTotal also reduced its price assumptions at about the same timeWhile majors often adjust price assumptions the investors noted that Shells auditors report contained substantially more references to climate risks than the previous yearIts tip of the iceberg LandellMills saidAnd investors will have to understand that they oil majors are not going to be able to pay dividends like they did before
