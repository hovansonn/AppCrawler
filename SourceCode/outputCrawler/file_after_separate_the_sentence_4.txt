!ðŸ™„ðŸ™„0Ssparklyrainbowdolphin16:58 22 Junplease do an episode.0CCustardTheCat18:45 21 JunWonder when they r gonna bring up Tyler 's parents divorce - i mean , with piper mentioning it , it has to happen now 0CCustardTheCat18:36 21 JunAnd like i said , holly totally stepped up about piper leaving .
It annoys me when Holly gets all passionate about something , like last week with A,y -Amy was finally getting her moment and then holly stepped in .
Not many of u will agree , but that's how I feel .sos if u disagree.
0CCustardTheCat18:31 21 JunCan't actually watch it but I'm guessing that they win the song writing competition that Holly 's mentioned in episode 4( the cranky camper ) 0EEsme17:43 21 JunOMG!!!!!
